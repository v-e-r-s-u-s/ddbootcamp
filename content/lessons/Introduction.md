Where do I start?

How long will it take?

When will I be job-ready?

In college, your entire curriculum for the next four years will be laid out for you from day one.
This is a two edged sword. It provides a means to ease you into the process and provides a tried
and true layout to mass produce education; however, it will not mirror the experience you will
likely encounter during your actual job.

When I got my first internship during college, I quickly realized my learning had just begun. I
learned more practical skills in one semester of my intership than I probably learned in my entire
software degree. That isn't to say my college experience was useless, but it serves to indicate
that your learning doesn't stop there.

For those coming from non-traditional backgrounds, you might actually have an advantage in some ways.
You are on your own to figure out how to learn it all and this process of learning to educate yourself
will serve you well throughout your career. Unless you are very fortunate, not many software shops
are going to take the time to hold your hand.



Ultimately, everyone is going to have their own journey in software, and that's not just because
everyone is a unique individual, but because software development is really about problem solving,
and problem solving is really a continuous process of learning.

With that said, if I could go back to the start of my own journey, I would first learn how to learn.
