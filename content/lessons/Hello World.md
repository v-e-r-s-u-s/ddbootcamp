# Our First Program
A traditional first step in software programming is to write a "Hello World" program. It is one of the easiest programs you can write in any language and you can immediately see the results.

With Javascript, it is even easier to start since you only need a browser.

Press `Ctrl` and click this [link](https://stackblitz.com/edit/dd10-exercises?file=index.html,hello-world%2Fhello-world.js) to open up a new tab with an IDE set up with a list of exercises.

Click into the `Hello World` exercise and you'll be presented with a preview that looks like the following.

Our goal is to modify hello-world.js so that our preview will read.

 # Tests

 Once you've modified hello-world.js to return the proper greeting, click the `Run Tests` link below your output to run an automated test to confirm your results. For now, this is a pretty simple test; however, future exercises may need further validation than simply seeing our message displayed.


# Console
In any browser window type `Ctrl + Shift + K` to bring up a Javascript console. If you've done it right, you should see something like this at the bottom of your window.
